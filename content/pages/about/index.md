Hi, I’m **Rahul** — a C++ developer at **Flow Edge Securities**, where I build **quant trading systems** that care about *microseconds more than coffee breaks*.  

I work across **C++ performance engineering**, **Python-based market analysis**, and occasionally enjoy overengineering **concurrent data structures** just for fun.  

When I’m not chasing latency, I’m usually diving into **option pricing models**, **market microstructure**, or just keeping up with the latest **financial news and analysis**.
